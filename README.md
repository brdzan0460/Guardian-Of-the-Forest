You don't member how did you get there, what were you doing, or even who you are. While analyzing your situation there came a myserious sound. Blue light comes from between trees, temporarly blinding you. When you can see again you can see a glowing crow sitting on the nerby branch of tree. It stands there as still as a stone figure, staring into your sould. Then you can hear a carrying voice in your head.

"You're the only hope of this forest..... The corruption .... the corruption is everywhere. It took over every single being in this forest, now they are feral and dangerouse. You need to stop it..... you need to defeat the source of the corruption and save this forest. Learn to control your new abilities and help to free the innocents...." 

And the crow dissapears as suddenly as it appeared. You sit there in the darkness.... as lost and confused as you were. But now you have goal so there is no point in waiting. you start heading in the way that crow dissapeared. And then you learn what crow meaned by the corruption. There are those weird beings made out of moving slime, infecting everything. You are afraid of them but you feel the new power flowing through you. You head to face your destiny, hoping that you will get to see the forest in its beautiful, clean form.
